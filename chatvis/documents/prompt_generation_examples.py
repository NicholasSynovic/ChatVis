I would like to use ParaView to visualize a dataset.
Please generate a ParaView Python script for the following operations.
Read in the file named '<input_path>'.
Trace streamlines of the V data array seeded from a default point cloud.
Render the streamlines with tubes. Add cone glyphs to the streamlines.
Color the streamlines and glyphs by the Temp data array.
View the result in the +X direction.
Save a screenshot of the result in the filename '<output_path>'.
The rendered view and saved screenshot should be 1920 x 1080 pixels.

This script uses ParaView to visualize streamlines of the V data array from the '<input_path>' file.
Operations include reading the file, tracing streamlines, rendering with tubes, adding cone glyphs, coloring by the Temp data array, and viewing from the +X direction.

Requirements:
- Read the file '<input_path>'.
- Trace streamlines of the V data array seeded from a default point cloud.
- Render the streamlines with tubes for better visibility.
- Add cone glyphs to the streamlines to indicate direction.
- Color both the streamlines and glyphs using the Temp data array.
- Orient the view to look from the +X direction.
- Save a screenshot of the view at 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution to '<output_path>'.
